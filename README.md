# 🧠 Oral Cancer Detection using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on the **early detection of oral cancer** using deep learning models. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing oral cancer at an early stage, improving patient outcomes, and reducing the time required for manual analysis.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build a deep learning model to classify **oral cancer vs. healthy tissue images**.  
- Improve accuracy using **CNN-based architectures**.  
- Provide an **easy-to-use interface** for prediction.  
- Contribute to healthcare AI by creating an **open-source framework** for oral cancer detection.  

## 🗂️ Dataset  
- The dataset consists of **oral cancer and non-cancer images**.  
- Preprocessing includes **resizing, normalization, and augmentation** (rotation, flipping, contrast enhancement).  
- *(Add your dataset source link here if public, or mention it’s private.)*  

## ⚙️ Methodology  
### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- Image cleaning, resizing, and augmentation.  

### 2. Model Development  
- CNN / Transfer Learning models (e.g., **VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, EfficientNet**).  

### 3. Training & Evaluation  
- Training with different hyperparameters.  
- Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**.  

### 4. Deployment  
- Model saved in **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** format.  
- Simple **notebook-based interface** for prediction.  

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:  
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch  
  - OpenCV  
  - NumPy, Pandas  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  
- **Deployment Options**: Streamlit / Flask (optional)  

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **91% accuracy with VGG19** on validation set.  
- Model shows promising results in distinguishing **oral cancer from healthy images**.  
- Evaluation includes **confusion matrix and ROC curve**.
